# Nice-to-have features
- Trigger Strava sync TTW.
- I want to be able to search sessions by exercise name so that I can see progress over time for individual exercise types. The presentation would be the same as the session list, but just show session name (not notes), the exercise in question as typically presented, and a link through to the session.
- Dark mode B-)
- Expand/collapse of sessions. By default, we should show the most recent two expanded and the rest collapsed
- HTMX-powered fetch more items. True for running history as well as lifting sessions (which should be limited to the past 6, say).
