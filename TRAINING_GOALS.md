# Training Goals & Target Events

## Current Target Events

**Primary:** Deception Pass 25K - December 14, 2025
- 3,000' elevation gain
- Technical trails and steep climbs
- Mix of terrain types

**Future Considerations:**
- Marathon in March or April 2026 (target: 3:30)
- Run Timberline Trail around Mt Hood in July 2026

## Background & Constraints

- 49-year old male, very active
- Current volume: 25-35 miles/week running, bike commute ~10 miles 3-4x/week
- Weekly futsal at high intensity
- History of tendonitis (feet, plantar fasciitis, Achilles)
- Left foot pronates more than right → tibialis posterior issues
- Lower back tightness

## Primary Goals

1. **Stay injury-free** (most important)
2. Continue playing futsal weekly
3. Maintain baseline conditioning:
   - Mt Hood climb in 4 hours (easy conditions)
   - Half marathon in 1:50 without additional training
4. Build muscle mass to aid running and combat aging effects

## Training Philosophy

- Steady load increases (avoid spikes)
- Regular stretching and mobility work
- Balance high-intensity activities (running hard + futsal) with recovery
- Strength training to support running and prevent injury

## Typical schedule
- Unless explicitly mentioned in prompts, assume a futsal game every Monday night
- That means the other high intensity running days are typically Wednesday (up to 7 miles, often tempo or hills) and Saturday (distance).
- Running almost always happens first thing in the morning, except for Tuesdays–because of futsal the night before, I run later, around lunch or early afternoon
- Lifting happens in the evenings during the week and midday on Sundays
- I do abs separately (typically 6-8 minutes of planks) 2-3 days/week–no need for explicit ab exercises in the plans
