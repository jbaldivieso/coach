## November 23
Follow the prompt at @PROMPT.md and create a training plan for the next
three weeks starting tomorrow (Nov 23). Key things to know about this
upcoming week: NO FUTSAL on Monday, so I'm prepared to do a workout of any
kind. (No longer than an hour.) Workout run of some kind on Wednesday is
great, could be longer than an hour but doesn't have to be. Week's long run
should happen Saturday as usual, or possibly Friday if there's a reason to
do so.

## November 30
Follow the prompt at @PROMPT.md and create a training plan for the next
three weeks starting tomorrow (Dec 1).

## December 7
Follow the prompt at @PROMPT.md and create a training plan for the next three weeks starting tomorrow (Dec 8). No futsal this Monday, but I do have it on Friday. May participate (carefully!), may not. Note that the race is *Sunday* Dec 14. (Some plan wording needs to be updated.) After the race, the next upcoming goals are looser. I'd like to maintain my base, though not necessarily with the same volume of vertical. I'd like to improve my speed for the, say, 10k distance.

## December 14
Follow the prompt at @PROMPT.md and create a training plan for the next three weeks starting tomorrow (Monday, Dec 15). So far we had been planning for me to race today, but that race got postponed until Feb 1. I'd like to maintain my fitness, while also taking advantage of the next few weeks to improve my speed a little and get back into lifting. This upcoming week is going to be pretty rainy, so I probably will get fewer runs in this week.
