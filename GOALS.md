- Background
  - I am a 49-year old male, very active. I run most days (20-35 miles a week, usually), bike commute ~10 miles 3-4 days a week, weightlift, and play futsal once a week at a high level of intensity. I run hard, and it’s a lot of pounding on hardwood floors.
  - I also am into ski mountaineering, mountaineering, and climbing.
  - I have a history of tendonitis in my feet. Left foot pronates more than the right, leading to issues with the tibialis posterior. Plantar fasciitis and Achilles tendonitis flare up at times in either foot, but I largely manage through steady load increasing and stretching. Issues with tightness in the lower back.

- General goals
    - Be injury free.
    - Continue to play futsal.
    - A standing objective is to have baseline conditioning to always be able to climb Mt Hood in 4 hours (assuming easy conditions) at a moment’s notice, or run a half marathon in 1:50 minutes without additional training.
    - Build muscle mass to aid in the above (inc running) as well as to combat the effects of aging.

- Specific training upcoming objectives
    - I'm running the Deception Pass 25K on Dec 14, 2025. It supposedly involves 3,000' of elevation gain. It's a challenging race with a mix of technical trails and steep climbs.
    - I am *considering* running a marathon in March or April 2026, with a target time of 3:40 hours.
    - I am also considering running the Timberline Trail around Mt Hood in July 2026

- Goal of this project
    - Planning for running distances and intensities, scheduled out at the week level
    - Planning for lifting, inc which exercises, # sets/# reps, rest durations
    - General advice for other areas related to fitness, health, recovery, etc.
